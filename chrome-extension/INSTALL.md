### How It Works
- **Automatic Detection**: Finds bid patterns like "$75", "80 dollars", "bid 65"
- **Real-Time Updates**: Sends new bids directly to your auction tracker
- **Facebook Integration**: Works on any Facebook auction post
- **Live Statistics**: Shows bids found and auctions tracked

### Troubleshooting
- If connection fails, make sure your auction tracker is running on port 5000
- Extension only works on Facebook.com pages
- Green status = monitoring active, Yellow = inactive

## Perfect for Commercial Use
This extension bypasses Facebook's anti-automation restrictions by running directly in your browser, making it ideal for professional auction dealers who need reliable bid tracking.
